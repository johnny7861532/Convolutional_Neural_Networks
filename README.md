CNN model of classification

Im using the newest keras to build my own CNN practice

And if you want to know more about keras this might help you out: https://keras.io

This is just a practice that using CNN to recognize the cats and dogs.
And hope this practice can help people more realize how to do CNN by their own.

Due to my Mac's computing power I lower some of the parameters, you can also adjust by yourself.
Such as batch size,input size and epochs.
If your model shows that its over fitting, please using the dropout function, some of my experience 0.5 might be the right number for reduce this problem.



Anyway hope anyone can learn keras fast, enjoy deep learning.
