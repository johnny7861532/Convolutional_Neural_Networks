CNN model of classification

Im using the newest keras to build my own CNN practice

### And if you want to know more about keras this might help you:

This is just a practice that using CNN to recognize cats and dogs.
And hoping this practice can help people more realize how to build their own CNN.

Due to my Mac's computing power I lower some of the parameters, you can also adjust by yourself.
Such as batch size,input size and epochs.
If your model shows that its overfitting, please using the dropout function, base on my experience 0.5 might be the right number to reduce this problem.

### How do you deal with overfitting -- dropout:

### Also a powerful way to increasing both accuracy and learning speed ###

*BatchNormalize()*

Anyway hope anyone can learn keras fast and enjoy deep learning.
